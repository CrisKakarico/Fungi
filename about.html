	  <h1>About Me</h1>
	  		
		<p>Hi, I'm Cris and I'm an indie developer who loves mushrooms! My passion for nature and programming has led me to create this website to share my knowledge and love of mushrooms with others.</p>
		<p>On this website, you will find all sorts of information about mushrooms, from identification to cultivation to culinary tips. I believe that mushrooms are fascinating organisms that are often overlooked, and I hope to inspire others to appreciate them as much as I do.</p>
		<p>When I'm not working on this website or coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors and admiring all the wonders that nature has to offer.</p>
		<p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you find the information here useful and informative!</p>
